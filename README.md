# Free and Beginner-Friendly Game Design Tools

## [Twine](https://twinery.org)

### Focus

Text-based interactive work, such as interactive fiction, electronic poetry, and text-based adventure games.

### Benefits

- Editor can run in browser, which means it support devices like Chromebooks that do not support desktop installation.
- Does not require digital asset creation.
- Great for focus on storytelling.
- Minimal coding required but also allows for advanced interactivity.
- Simple process to publish online.

### Examples

- [Queers in Love at the End of the World](https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world) by [Anna Anthropy](https://w.itch.io/)
- [Howling Dogs](https://xrafstar.monster/games/twine/howlingdogs/) by [Porpentine Charity Heartscape](https://xrafstar.monster/)
- [Hitch (beta)](https://chriscollins.online/hitch-beta-1) by [Chris Collins](https://chriscollins.online/)

## [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org/)

### Focus

Games using the format of a character walking around and talking with other characters and using a minimal pixel art aesthetic.

### Benefits

- Like Twine, the editor runs in a web browser.
- Uses built-in pixel art creator so great for dipping toes into visual storytelling without learning other programs for asset generation.

### Examples

- [Fish Quest](https://w.itch.io/fish-quest) by [Anna Anthropy](https://w.itch.io/)
- [almanac of girlswampwar territory & the \_girls who swim as fertilizer through the warm soil cloaking the roots of the glorious tree of eugenics (giving birth to a black hole in a walmart parking lot at 1am)](https://porpentine.itch.io/almanac) by [Porpentine Charity Heartscape](https://xrafstar.monster/)

## [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

### Focus

Broad range of 2D and 3D interactive content, with deeper support for 2D.

### Benefits

- Full 2D engine with 3D support. This means way less limitations than Twine or Bitsy but also a much steeper learning curve.
- Includes a custom language GDScript, which is quite similar (though independent from) Python. As such, it has a syntax that many beginners would find more friendly than C++ or C#, which are used in popular engines Unreal and Unity.
- Unlike most other popular engines, Godot is free without restrictions and open source.
